# To establish associactions in sequelize, we have 4 methods:
* hasOne and this is a oneToOne association (like a country has only one capital and a capital has one country)
* belongsTo and this is a oneToOne association
* hasToMany and this is a oneToMany association (like a user has too many posts)
* belongsToMany and this is a ManyToMany association
